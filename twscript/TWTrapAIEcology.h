/** @class TWTrapAIEcology
 *
 * TWTrapAIEcology is a script that allows a controlled population of AIs to be
 * spawned dynamically during play.
 *
 * Periodically this script will check whether the number of currently spawned AIs
 * has reached a configurable population limit. If the count is less than the
 * limit, the script will select an AI archetype to spawn, and then choose a spawn
 * point at which the AI should be created.
 *
 * At most one AI is spawned each time the script checks the current population.
 * This is a deliberate restriction imposed to prevent AIs being spawned on top of
 * each other).
 *
 * The AI archetype is chosen based on links from the TWTrapAIEcology host object
 * to archetypes. By default the script will use weighted random selection if
 * multiple AI archetypes are linked, and if only a single AI archetype is linked
 * that is always used).
 *
 * The spawn point is chosen based on links from the TWTrapAIEcology to concrete
 * objects in the world. If multiple spawn points are linked, one is chosen at
 * random, whereas if only one spawn point is linked that one is always used. The
 * default behaviour is to try and find the first randomly selected spawn point
 * that is not visible on screen. if all spawn points are on screen, spawning is
 * aborted. This behaviour can be disabled if desired.
 *
 *
 *
 * It is important to note that, while a fnord (a Marker or similar) could be used
 * to mark the location of a spawn point, using a standard fnord is NOT recommended.
 * fnord objects are not rendered (do not see the fnord, if you can't see the fnord
 * it can't eat you), this means that the* engine can not determine whether the
 * object is on screen: it will always say it is not because, well, you can't see it;
 * it's not rendered! While this is a fine attribute for a normal fnord to have, if
 * you want to make sure that AIs are always spawned off-screen, you can't use a fnord
 * unless you give it a transparent, physicsless object and change its Render Type
 * to 'Normal'.
